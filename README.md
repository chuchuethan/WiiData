# Tools Used:
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Seaborn

# Goal
Study and assess what makes a Nintendo game succesful. Do certain genres perform better than others? Since certain systems are more successful than others, what made them so successful? How does Nintendo's brand play into all of this? If Nintendo were to release a new system (like the Switch 2!), what games should they release with it to have a successful launch and gain momentum on the new system?
